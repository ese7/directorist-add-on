Easily import listings from any XML or CSV file to Directorist with the Directorist Add-On for WP All Import.

== Description ==

The Directorist Add-On for [WP All Import](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import "WordPress XML & CSV Import") makes it easy to bulk import your listings to the Directorist plugin in less than 10 minutes.

The left side shows all of the fields that you can import to and the right side displays the data from your XML/CSV file. Then, you can simply drag & drop the data from your XML or CSV into the Directorist fields to import them.

The importer is so intuitive it is almost like manually configuring Directorist when adding/editing a post.

It's easy to begin with our [Quickstart Guide](https://www.wpallimport.com/documentation/getting-started/importing-an-xml-or-csv-file/).

= Why you should use the Directorist Add-On for WP All Import =

* Import new posts, pages, or custom post types and configure their listings all in the same import.

* Update existing listings already published on your site with [Bulk Edit](https://www.wpallimport.com/bulk-edit-wordpress-data/).

* Compatible with all other [WP All Import add-ons](https://www.wpallimport.com/add-ons/).

* Complete support - configure all available listing fields.

= WP All Import Professional Edition =

The Directorist Add-On for WP All Import is fully compatible with [the free version of WP All Import](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import "WordPress XML & CSV Import"). 

However, [the professional edition of WP All Import](https://www.wpallimport.com/pricing/?utm_source=free-plugin&utm_medium=dot-org&utm_campaign=directorist) includes premium support and adds the following features:

* Import files from a URL: Download and import files from external websites, even if they are password-protected with HTTP authentication. 

* Cron Job/Recurring Imports: WP All Import Pro can periodically check a file for updates, then add, edit, delete, and update your listings.

* Custom PHP Functions: Pass your data through custom functions by using [my_function({data[1]})] in your import template. WP All Import will pass the value of {data[1]} through my_function and use whatever it returns.

* Access to premium technical support.
